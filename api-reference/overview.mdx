## Integration Implementation Guide

There are two methods for integrating Phoenix into your application:

1. **React Component** - A pre-built React component that you can drop into your application
2. **Manual Integration** - A vanilla JavaScript approach for other frameworks or custom implementations

Choose the integration method that best fits your tech stack and requirements.
