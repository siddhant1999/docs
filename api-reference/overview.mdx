## Integration Implementation Guide

There are three methods for integrating Phoenix into your application:

1. **React Component** - A pre-built React component that you can drop into your application
2. **React Native Component** - A pre-built React Native component for iOS and Android apps
3. **HTML Integration** - A vanilla HTML/JavaScript approach for other frameworks or custom implementations

Choose the integration method that best fits your tech stack and requirements.
