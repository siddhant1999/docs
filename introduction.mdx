## What is Phoenix Market?

Phoenix Market is a trustless P2P marketplace for USD-USDC transactions. Our platform enables seamless, secure trading between users without requiring KYC verification.

<Info>
  Phoenix is the fastest P2P marketplace for USD-USDC transactions. Because we never take custody of funds, Phoenix is the first P2P solution that allows users to quickly onramp with Zelle payments with no KYC.
</Info>

By operating outside the flow of funds similar to DEXs like Uniswap, Phoenix maintains a non-money transmitter status while still enforcing AML compliance via Anchain.ai to prevent interaction with sanctioned funds.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Smart Contract Escrow">
    Sellers lock their USDC in an escrow smart contract
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Initiation">
    The buyer initiates a Zelle transfer through our provided webapp component
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Verification">
    Phoenix uses Teller to verify that the USD payment has been made, upon which the USDC is automatically released to the buyer from escrow
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transaction Completion">
    The buyer receives their USDC in under 2 minutes
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Payment Flows

Phoenix supports two payment flows to accommodate different user scenarios:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Automated Zelle Payment">
    <div className="flex items-start gap-3">
      <div>
        <p className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Seamless Bank Integration</p>
        <p>Users can log in to their supported bank directly within the payment interface. The Zelle payment will be automatically executed on their behalf, creating a frictionless experience.</p>
        
        <div className="mt-4">
          <p className="font-semibold">Supported Banks:</p>
          <div className="flex flex-wrap gap-2 mt-2">
            <span className="px-3 py-1 bg-green-100 text-green-800 rounded-full text-sm">Chase</span>
            <span className="px-3 py-1 bg-green-100 text-green-800 rounded-full text-sm">Bank of America</span>
            <span className="px-3 py-1 bg-green-100 text-green-800 rounded-full text-sm">Capital One</span>
            <span className="px-3 py-1 bg-green-100 text-green-800 rounded-full text-sm">Citi</span>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <Warning className="mt-4">
      <strong>Limitations:</strong> Teller (our banking integration provider) does not currently handle Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with Zelle. While Zelle rarely forces MFA, new users or those engaging in suspicious activity may be required to complete MFA. In these cases, users will be directed to the Manual Zelle Payment flow.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Manual Zelle Payment">
    <div className="flex items-start gap-3">
      <div>
        <p className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Universal Compatibility</p>
        <p>For users without supported banks or those who encounter MFA issues, we offer a manual payment option. Users will:</p>
        
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
          <li>Open their banking app or Zelle app</li>
          <li>Make the Zelle payment manually to the provided recipient</li>
          <li>Return to Phoenix where we verify the payment</li>
          <li>Once verified, USDC is automatically released from escrow</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
    </div>

    <Info className="mt-4">
      This flow works with any bank that supports Zelle, providing universal coverage for your users.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Both payment flows maintain the same security and verification standards, ensuring safe and compliant transactions regardless of which method your users choose.
