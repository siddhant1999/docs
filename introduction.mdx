title: 'Introduction to Phoenix'
description: 'Phoenix Market is a trust-minimized P2P marketplace that allows peers to quickly and securely swap between USD and USDC without the need for KYC.'
---



<Info>
  Phoenix is the fastest P2P marketplace for USD-USDC transactions. Because we never take custody of funds, Phoenix is the first P2P solution that allows users to quickly onramp with Zelle payments without KYC.
</Info>

Phoenix Market does not hold or transmit fiat at any point in time. Phoenix maintains a non-money transmitter status while enforcing AML compliance via Anchain.ai to prevent interaction with sanctioned funds.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Smart Contract Escrow">
    Sellers lock their USDC in an escrow smart contract
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Initiation">
    The buyer initiates a Zelle transfer through our provided webapp component
  </Step>
  <Step title="Payment Verification">
    Phoenix uses [Teller](https://teller.io) to verify that the USD payment has been made, upon which the USDC is automatically released to the buyer from escrow
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transaction Completion">
    The buyer receives their USDC in under a minute to their provided wallet address
  </Step>
</Steps>

    ### Security & Data Protection
    Phoenix implements multiple layers of security for automated payments:

    #### Technical Security Measures
    - We establish secure mutual TLS (mTLS) connections with Teller for all banking operations
    - All API endpoints use TLS encryption for data in transit
    - Strict rate limiting and request validation prevent automated attacks
    - Each transaction uses a one-time access token generated by Teller
    - Access tokens cannot be reused, ensuring each banking session is isolated

    #### Banking Integration Security
    1. When a user initiates a payment:
       - A secure mTLS connection is established with Teller
       - The user is redirected to Teller's secure login page
       - Bank credentials are entered directly on Teller's interface
       
    2. During authentication:
       - The bank may require 2FA based on their security policies
       - All authentication happens directly between the user and Teller
       - Phoenix never sees or handles login credentials
    </Tab>
    
    <Tab title="Manual Zelle Payment">
      <div className="flex items-start gap-3">
        <div>
          <p className="text-lg font-semibold mb-2">Universal Compatibility</p>
          <p>For users without supported banks or those who encounter MFA issues, we offer a manual payment option. Users will:</p>
          
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>Open their banking app</li>
            <li>Make the Zelle payment manually to the provided recipient</li>
            <li>Return to Phoenix where we verify the payment</li>
            <li>Once verified, USDC is automatically released from escrow</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </div>

      <Note className="mt-4">
        For security and transaction verification, we add a unique random number of cents (between \$0.00 and \$0.20) to each transaction amount. The user will receive these addition cents in USDC. This is not a fee.
      </Note>

      ### Security & Data Protection
      Phoenix implements multiple layers of security for manual payments:

      #### Technical Security Measures
      - All API endpoints use TLS encryption for data in transit
      - Strict rate limiting and request validation prevent automated attacks
      - Payment verification is done securely through Teller

      #### Transaction Security
      1. When a user initiates a payment:
         - User is prompted to confirm the payment details
         - A unique transaction identifier is generated

         
      2. During verification:
         - Phoenix verifies the payment securely through Teller
         - The smart contract automatically releases USDC upon confirmation
         - All transaction data is validated before processing
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>

Both payment flows maintain the same security and verification standards, ensuring safe and compliant transactions regardless of which method your users choose.
